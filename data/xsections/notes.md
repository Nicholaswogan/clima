- *NO* I used Phidrates database. Eventually I should use the polynomial fit thing.
- *C4H2* xs is 2 times C2H2 xs.
- *HSO* set to HO2. Kevin says "HSO is more stable than HO2, but, you know, photolysis never really matters for these short-lived species"
- *HNO*. Kevin uses a constant photolysis rate. I'm going to omit it for now.
- *HNO2*. Kevin uses a constant photolysis rate. I'm going to omit it for now.
- *S8L*. Estimate for cross section of linear S8 chains in visible. set equal to S8R in uv
- *CH3OH*. CH3OH + hv  => CH3O +  H  this branch is reported 86Â±10%. The other processes are undetected
- *CH3CN*. CH3CN + HV  -> CH3 +  CN     ! the H + CH2CN is in fact somewhat more important



missing:
'CO2', 'H2CO', 'HNO', 'HNO2', 'O2', 'O3', 'SO2'

I'm using Kevin's cross sections for all species except the following, which use Phidrates database.

'CO2', 'H2CO', 'O2', 'O3', 'SO2', 'NO'

I omit the following photolysis reactions

```yaml
- equation: SO2 + hv => S + O + O
  type: photolysis
  - equation: HNO + hv => NO + H
    rate-constant:
      A: 1.0e-3
      b: 0.0
      Ea: 0.0
  - equation: HNO2 + hv => NO + OH
    rate-constant:
      A: 1.0e-3
      b: 0.0
      Ea: 0.0
```

I omit `SO2 + hv => S + O + O` because Phidrates has no data for this reaction. I omit `HNO + hv => NO + H` and `HNO2 + hv => NO + OH` because Kevin hard-codes rates instead of using cross sections. I am unable to find cross sections.

I noticed that when modeling Mars, CO2 photolysis was much higher than previous models. It looks like the Phidrates cross sections are too large for CO2 + hv => CO + O branch. So I switched to Kevin Z CO2 cross sections. NOW i use Kevin's cross sections for all but

'H2CO', 'O2', 'O3', 'SO2', 'NO'

Which uses Phidrates.
