    # `k-method` is the method for mixing k-distributions. Options are
    #
    # k-method: RandomOverlap
    # k-method: RandomOverlapResortRebin
    # k-method: AdaptiveEquivalentExtinction
    # 
    # These methods are explained in Amundsen et al. (2017) (DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201629322).
    k-method: RandomOverlapResortRebin

    # If you choose method RandomOverlapResortRebin, then you must supply
    # `number-of-bins`, which is the number of bins the method rebins to
    number-of-bins: 16

    # Here you specify opacites. You can see avaliable opacities by looking in
    # `clima/data/` folder. `CIA`, `rayleigh`, `photolysis-xs` and `water-continuum`
    # are optional. If you omit these keys then these opacities will not be included.
    # `k-distributions` is a required key for now.
    opacities:
     # k-distributions
      k-distributions: [H2O, CO2]

      # CIA opacities
      CIA: [CO2-CO2, N2-N2]

      # Rayleigh scattering. You can optionally do
      # rayleigh: true
      # which activates all possible rayleigh species
      rayleigh: [H2O, CO2, N2]

      # Potolysis cross sections. Specify true/false or a list of species
      photolysis-xs: false
