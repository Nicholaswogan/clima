    # `k-method` is the method for mixing k-distributions. Options are
    #
    # k-method: RandomOverlap
    # k-method: RandomOverlapResortRebin
    # k-method: AdaptiveEquivalentExtinction
    # 
    # These methods are explained in Amundsen et al. (2017) (DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201629322).
    k-method: RandomOverlapResortRebin

    # If you choose method RandomOverlapResortRebin, then you must supply
    # `number-of-bins`, which is the number of bins the method rebins to
    number-of-bins: 16

    # Here you specify opacites. You can see avaliable opacities by looking in
    # `clima/data/` folder. `CIA`, `rayleigh`, `photolysis-xs` and `water-continuum`
    # are optional. If you omit these keys then these opacities will not be included.
    # `k-distributions` is the only required key. The simplest way to set opacities
    # is to just to turn them `on`, as shown below, which will use all available 
    # opacities
